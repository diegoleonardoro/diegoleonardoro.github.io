    <div id='secondBlock'>
        <p>The busiest day was Tuesdays with 592.345 rides and the least busy day was Sundays with 205.548. The
            difference
            between the busiest day and the least busy day was 386.797 rides. That seems like a big difference but
            let's compare it

    <div class='scatter_plot'></div>

    <div id='thirdBlock'>
        <p>From the previous graph, we can say that most stations have a difference between the busiest and least busy
            day
            below 400.000, which is similat to Diversey Station. This can lead us to the conclusion that the areas in
            the
            city where most stations are located have similar transit characteristics as the Diversey Station and
            consequently Landmark's Century Centre Cinema.

        <p>From the previous graphs, we can infer that theatres that offer independent and foreign language films tend
            to
            be located in affluent neighborhoods, predominantly white, with a young and educated population. This would
            be
            enough to think that niehgborhoods that are economically vibrant, with services that satisfy a good taste
            are
            neighborhoods that where a theatre offering independent and foreign language films would succeed </p>

        <p>But to further test this, let's look at the places in Chicago that have received the most restaurant license
            applications and how they correlate to the places where theatres that offer independent and foreign
            language
            films tend to operate </p>

        its new location. This zipcode received 410 applications for restaurant license and it is relatively near to
        the area in the city with most independent theatres.
