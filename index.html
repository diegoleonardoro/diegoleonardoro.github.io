            a
            new location in Chicago. </p>

        <h2>Challenge: </h2>
        <p>Chicago has a good supply of theatres that satisfy the demand for independent and foreing movies. They are
            scattered throughout they city, and they serve a unique audience. Due to one and a half successful decade,
            with a solid and growing customer base, Landmark's Theatre is now looking for an untapped location to open a
            new theatre.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do so, it is necessary to understand the area where Landmark's Century Centre Cinema is located to see
            if it has unique characteristics that should be replicated in its new location.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the area where Landmark's Century Centre Cinema is located: </h2>

    <div id='secondBlock'>
        <p>The busiest day at Diversey was Tuesdays with 592.345 rides and the least busy day was Sundays with 205.548 riders. The
            difference
            between the busiest day and the least busy day was 386.797 rides. That seems like a big difference, but

        <p>From the previous graph, we can say that most stations have a difference between the busiest and least busy
            day
            below 400.000, which is similar to Diversey. This can lead us to the conclusion that the areas in
            the
            city where most stations have similar transit characteristics to Diversey  and
            consequently to Landmark's Century Centre Cinema.

        <p>From the previous graphs, we can infer that theatres that offer independent and foreign language films tend
            to
            be located in affluent neighborhoods, predominantly white, with a young and educated population. This
            could lead us to think that niehgborhoods that are economically vibrant, with services that satisfy a demand for 
            culture and good food are
            neighborhoods where theatre offering independent and foreign language films would succeed </p>

        <p>But to further test this, let's look at the places in Chicago that have received the most restaurant license
            applications and how they correlate to the places where theatres that offer independent and foreign
            language
            films tend to operate. This data was taken from <a href='https://data.cityofchicago.org/'>The City of Chicago open dta portal</a> </p>

        After analyzing the above data, we suggest that Landmark's Century Centre Cinema considers zipcode 60639 for
        its new location. This zipcode received 410 applications for restaurant license, which can be an indication that this area is 
        economically vibrant. At the same time, this zipcode is relatively close to the are where most theatres are located without being too close to them
